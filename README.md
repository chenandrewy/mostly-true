Code to accompany "Most claimed statistical findings in cross-sectional return predictability are likely true"

Code performs non- and semi-parametric FDR estimates a la Benjamini-Hochberg-Storey on the anomaly zoo, as well as simulation verifications.  The code is a lot more complicated than it needs to be, because it handles many cases not examined in the paper.  These other cases lead to the same result, so I just went with the simple stuff in the paper.
